# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Step 1:Import the library numpy using import command.Import sys library same as numpy.
2. Step 2:Get input from the user for number of rows and add it by 1 for number of columns.
3. Step 3:Using np.zeros(),set the matrix as null matrix.
4. Step 4:Using nested for loop to get input from the user for each element in the matrix. 
5. Step 5:Using nested for loop find the ratio and perform the elementary row operations and find the final matrix.
6. Step 6:Use back substituion method to find the value of the variables and print it.

## Program:
```

```

## Output:
![gaussian elimination]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
